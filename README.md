# HHFK

HHFK is a **MVC Framework** based on **Hack** to run on Hip-Hop Virtual Machine (**HHVM**).
The framework has been thought to be the simpliest and easiest to use. 
The project respect the PSR-4 for his namespaces and autoloads.

It is based around Modules structure  for more flexibility.
Those modules can be bound to your application either by creating a Service to encapsulate it or just used directly in your code.
Externals modules can be added using **composer**.

It tries the best to run on HHVM strict mode to speed your application up.
